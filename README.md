# Face Detection & Recognition System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time Face Detection and Recognition system** using Python.  
It detects human faces from a webcam feed and recognizes known individuals by comparing facial features with pre-stored data.

The system is capable of handling **multiple faces simultaneously** and allows easy addition of new users.

## 📁 Dataset
Due to privacy concerns, face images are not included in this repository.
Users can create their own dataset by adding images in the following format:

dataset/
└── Person_Name/
